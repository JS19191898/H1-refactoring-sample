# js-hw-1

Project Description
  I refactored existing code for a client per their wishes. Specifically, I replaced div elements for semantic elements within the html, editing the corresponding css code as well. I also made sure to tidy up the nesting of the html code. Finally, I left comments on my changes in green underneath certain lines in the css file.
